                                Libnet is a collection of routines to help with the construction and
                                handling of network packets.  It provides a portable framework for
                                low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection.  Libnet
                                features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and link
                                layer, as well as a host of supplementary and complementary
                                functionality.  Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly
                                applications can be whipped up with little effort.

                                TCPslice is a tool for extracting portions of packet
                                trace files generated using tcpdump's <code>-w</code> flag. It
                                can combine multiple trace files, and/or extract
                                portions of one or more traces based on time.
                                TCPslice originally comes from LBL and now is
                                maintained by The Tcpdump Group.

                                tcpflow is a program that captures data transmitted as part of TCP
                                connections (flows), and stores the data in a way that is convenient for
                                protocol analysis or debugging.  A program like 'tcpdump' shows a
                                summary of packets seen on the wire, but usually doesn't store the data
                                that's actually being transmitted.  In contrast, tcpflow reconstructs
                                the actual data streams and stores each flow in a separate file for
                                later analysis.

                                network traffic and looks for suspicious activity.
                                Zeek detects intrusions by first parsing network
                                traffic to extract its application-level semantics
                                and then executing event-oriented analyzers that
                                compare the activity with patterns deemed
                                troublesome. Its analysis includes detection of
                                specific attacks (including those defined by
                                signatures, but also those defined in terms of
                                events) and unusual activities (e.g., certain

                                of failed connection attempts).

                                A free network protocol analyzer for Unix and Windows. It allows
                                you to examine data from a live network or from a capture file on
                                disk. You can interactively browse the capture data, viewing summary
                                and detail information for each packet. Wireshark has several powerful
                                features, including a rich display filter language and the ability
                                to view the reconstructed stream of a TCP session.

                                CoralReef is a software suite developed by
                                <a class=away href="https://www.caida.org/">CAIDA</a> to analyze data collected
                                by passive Internet traffic monitors.  It provides a programming
                                library libcoral, similar to libpcap with extensions for ATM and
                                other network types, which is available from both C and Perl.  The
                                software presently supports dedicated PC boxes using OC3mon and
                                OC12mon cards that collect traffic data in real time, as well as
                                reading from pcap tracefiles.  Version 3.4 to be released soon
                                supports listening via bpf enabled devices.  CoralReef includes
                                drivers, analysis, web report generation, examples, and capture
                                software.  This package is maintained by CAIDA developers with the
                                support and collaboration of the Internet measurement community.

                                transmission the kernel does not need to copy packets from kernel space to
                                user space and vice versa.

                                pcapfix is a repair tool for corrupted pcap and pcapng files. It checks

                                are any corrupted bytes. If a header is not present, one is created and
                                added to the beginning of the file. It then tries to find pcap packet
                                headers or packet blocks, and checks and repairs them.

                                rewritten since then with hundreds of releases improving Npcap's

                                sequence of port-hits.  When detected, it will run a specified event
                                bound to that port knock sequence.  These port-hits need not be on
                                open ports, since it uses libpcap to sniff the raw interface

                                a client. Using a client, you can create new capture sessions,
                                modify them, pull up stats on running sessions, and so on.

                                capstats is a small tool to collect statistics on the current load
                                of a network interface, using either libpcap or the native interface
                                for Endace hardware. It reports statistics per time interval and/or
                                for the tool's total run-time.

                                pmacct is a small set of multi-purpose passive network monitoring tools.
                                It can account, classify, aggregate, replicate and export forwarding-plane
                                data, i.e. IPv4 and IPv6 traffic; collect and correlate control-plane data
                                via BGP and BMP; collect and correlate RPKI data; collect infrastructure
                                data via Streaming Telemetry. Each component works both as a standalone
                                daemon and as a thread of execution for correlation purposes (i.e. enrich
                                NetFlow with BGP data).

                                such as tcpdump and snoop.

                                (SCCP), MGCP and WebRTC VoIP protocols running on
                                Linux.  VoIPmonitor is designed to analyze quality of

                                variation and packet loss according to ITU-T G.107
                                E-model, which predicts quality on MOS scale.  Calls
                                with all relevant statistics are saved to a MySQL
                                database.  Optionally each call can be saved to a .pcap

                                create a .pcap file containing actual packet data.
